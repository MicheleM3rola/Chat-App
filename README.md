The Chat Application is developed with React for the Front-End and Node.js for the backend with Socket.io as framework for the real-time bidirectional 
communication.

In the First Route or First Page we can create our Nickname and we can create a new room or decide to join one that already exist, and in the second Route we have the chat on the left and the list of user currently in the same room.
